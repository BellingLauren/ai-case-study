## Waymo: Ride Share Getting Waymo Better

## Overview and Origin

Waymo, formerly Google Self-Driving Car Project, was founded in January 2009 by Sebastian Thrun and Anthony Levandowski. [1][2] The idea for this project was to fully autonomous vehicles to improve mobility, be safer, and free up time for people to do other things. [3] The funding for this project has been from multiple sources including Alphabet who has reportedly donated 5 billion dollars to the project.[4]

## Business Activities

Waymo is trying to change the way people move from place to place. The initiative of this project is to allow everyone a safer way to travel while giving them precious time during their commute back. Currently, this project is only being utilized in a small market but the goal is to have self-driving cars everywhere. While other companies are trying to catch up to the current innovation standards Waymo has set, their advantage is being first to market. Competitors new to the industry are still trying to catch up to the artificial intelligence Google has produced and implemented into Waymo today. Waymo uses some of the following applications and data to make its self-driving cars a success AngularJs, Google App Engine, Google Tag Manager, and Google Maps.[5]

## Landscape

Waymo is a part of the Autonomous Car field which has evolved over time. In the last 10 years, cars have started to integrate AI slowly with self-parking, lane assist, and cruise control (self-adjusting to speed limits and traffic) for just a few examples. Some of the other main players in the field would be Cruise, Tesla, and Zoox,[6] 

## Results

Waymo has impacted the way people travel in a safe and reliable way. In September 2024, Waymo reported in its first 22 million miles that they have had 84% fewer airbag deployment crashes, 73% fewer injury-causing crashes, and 48% fewer police-reported crashes compared to a human driving the same distance in the cities they are operated.[7] This data suggests that Waymo provides a safer driving environment for everyone on the roads. Compared to competitors in the industry, Waymo continues to improve technology to help them stay competitive in the field and provide a safe driving experience for every passenger involved.

## Recommendations

The possibilities for Waymo are limitless.  In the future, Waymo could deliver essential items such as groceries or medications to mobility-constrained individuals.  There could also be instances where Waymo is the preferred option for delivery or transportation for individuals concerned with privacy or safety. For this to happen, the company would have to integrate software to communicate with pharmacies and vehicles to route to each location and integrate additional AI technologies to deliver from vehicle to front door delivery, such as a drone.
