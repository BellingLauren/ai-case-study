## Waymo: Ride Share Getting Waymo Better

## Overview and Origin

Waymo, formerly known as Google Self-Driving Car Project, was founded in January, 2009 by Sebastian Thrun and Anthony Levandowski. [1][2] The idea for this project was to fully autonomous vehicles to improve mobility, be safer and free up time for people to do other things. [3] By 2015, the first fully autonomous ride was completed on public roads by a blind man in Austin, TX. [2] After more success in the industry in 2016 Waymo was established under Alphabet as a self-driving technology company.[2] By 2017 Waymo started the early rider program allowing residents in the Arizona’s Metro Phoenix are to join on their first public trial of autonomous ride-hailing.[2] The funding for this project has been from multiple sources including Alphabet who has reportedly donated 5 billion dollars to the project.[4] 

## Business Activities

Waymo is trying to change the way people move from place to place. The initiative of this project is to allow everyone a safer way to travel while giving them precious time during their commute back. Currently, this project is only being utilized in a small market but the goal is to have self-driving cars everywhere. While other companies are trying to catch up to the current innovation standards Waymo has set, their advantage is being first to market. Competitors new to the industry are still trying to catch up to the artificial intelligence Google has produced and implemented into Waymo today. Waymo uses some of the following applications and data to make its self-driving cars a success AngularJs, Google App Engine, Google Tag Manager, and Google Maps.[5]

## Landscape

Waymo is a part of the Autonomous Car field which has evolved over time. In the last 10 years, cars have started to integrate AI slowly with self-parking, lane assist, and cruise control (self-adjusting to speed limits and traffic) for just a few examples. Some of the other main players in the field would be Cruise, Tesla, Uber, Lift, Aurora, Nuro, Zoox, and even public transportation.[6] The desire for autonomous ride-sharing capabilities, coupled with safety and security is a trend that will continue to rise as AI integrates in the automotive industry. 

## Results

Waymo has impacted the way people travel in a safe and reliable way. In September 2024, Waymo reported in its first 22 million miles that they have had 84% fewer airbag deployment crashes, 73% fewer injury-causing crashes, and 48% fewer police-reported crashes compared to a human driving the same distance in the cities they are operated.[7] This data suggests that Waymo provides a safer driving environment for everyone on the roads. Compared to competitors in the industry, Waymo continues to improve technology to help them stay competitive in the field and provide a safe driving experience for every passenger involved. Waymo has traveled more than 4X farther than its competitors for example Aurora has only traveled roughly 4.5 million miles (road driven & simulation) since the company started in 2017.[8]

"By making detailed information about crashes and miles driven publicly accessible, Waymo’s transparency will not only support independent research but foster public trust. We hope other companies developing and deploying automated driving systems follow suit.”- David Zuby, Chief Research Officer, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)[9]

## Recommendations

The possibilities for Waymo are limitless.  In the future, Waymo could deliver essential items such as groceries or medications to mobility-constrained individuals.  There could also be instances where Waymo is the preferred option for delivery or transportation for individuals concerned with privacy or safety. For this to happen, the company would have to integrate software to communicate with pharmacies and vehicles to route to each location and integrate additional AI technologies to deliver from vehicle to front door delivery, such as a drone.
